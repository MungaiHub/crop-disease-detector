# ðŸŒ± AI-Powered Crop Disease Detector (Prototype)

This project is a **Streamlit web app** that allows farmers to scan crop leaves for diseases using either:
- ðŸ“‚ Uploading an image from their computer, or
- ðŸ“¸ Capturing a live photo using the webcam

The system then detects the disease (currently simulated with random selection) and provides **treatment recommendations** including:
- Chemical controls (fungicides/insecticides)
- Trade names commonly used
- Recommended dosage and spray intervals
- Alternative cultural practices

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Dual input options: **upload** or **webcam**
- Simulated AI model for plant disease detection (to be replaced with CNN in future)
- Clear treatment recommendations
- Simple and user-friendly interface with Streamlit
